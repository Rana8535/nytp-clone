              Phishing scams continue to proliferate across the internet; no

              Decreasing cases of COVID have reignited several employers’
              eagerness to return to in-office work, though not all employees
              share these sentiments — having grown used to remote work. This
              article reviews why returning to in-person work can be a good
              idea, and what incentives are being offered to some employees as

            <p>
              Trials and Tribulations Faced by Healthcare Early in the Pandemic
              As written previously within this blog, the world of hiring has
              been sent into a tumultuous state since the onset of the COVID
              pandemic. While the valiant efforts of healthcare workers have
              become increasingly recognized by society following their response
              to the onset of the global pandemic, some healthcare workers have
              found themselves out of work as a result of financial challenges
              brought by the pandemic.

              STEM professions — which encompass the Science, Technology,
              Engineering and Math fields — have historically suffered from a
              gap in female participation. While American female high school
              students outperform their male peers in Math and Science on
              average (as seen in Fig. 2 below), relatively few women enroll in
              STEM-related majors

              The year 2020 brought about massive societal changes across the
              world in ways few could have predicted in 2019. Looking ahead to
              2021, it is clear to see that the Coronavirus epidemic defined
              many of the global social and economic currents, and will continue
              to have an influence, even after measures such as social
              distancing are eased

            <p>
              Introduction: Remote Work Becomes a New Normal The growth of
              remote working, as spurred by the COVID-19 epidemic, has prompted
              an at once sudden and now sustained growth in the popularity of
              remote work (also referred to as telework) across several
              industries. According to a study conducted by Clutch.co, before
              the pandemic, 47% of American survey participants had “Never”
              worked remotely. After COVID-19, 44% of survey respondents stated
              that they worked remotely “5+ days per week”.

              Recent Changes to U.S. H1-B Visas and What It Means for Businesses
            </h1>
            <p>
              A recent executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump is
              set to suspend many new work H1-B visas until the end of 2020,
              thus preventing foreign workers (and their spouses) from seeking
              residence while working U.S. jobs. The order’s intent claims to
              “put American workers first when hiring… at a time when so many
              Americans are out of work [due to the coronavirus recovery]”. The
              motion is not a full curb on foreign worker immigration, however.
              The order also claims that the new program “will prioritize those
              workers who are offered the highest wage, ensuring the
              highest-skilled applicants are admitted”.

            <h1>Why Ghosting a Potential Employer is Never a Good Idea</h1>
            <p>
              Have you ever heard of “ghosting”? The term originates from the
              world of online dating — used to describe the faux-pas act of an
              individual abruptly ending all communication with someone with no
              provided explanation, effectively abandoning the individual on the
              other end. Since the term (and the social phenomenon) has spread
              across dating apps, the behavior of ghosting has been noted across
              a variety of different avenues — including but not limited to job
              applications.

              The first days, weeks, and months are often crucial for laying the
              foundation of a successful new hire. An increasing emphasis is
              being placed on Employee Experience (EX) in many companies — a
              broad term encompassing training, company benefits, policies, and
              company culture. According to a 2020 study conducted by LinkedIn,
              companies that rated highly on EX factors experienced lower
              attrition rates. The study found that companies with highly rated
              employee training had a 53% lower attrition rate, and companies
              with a highly rated purposeful mission received a 49% lower
              attrition rate

              While the U.S. unemployment rate continues to decline — reaching

              themselves unemployed or underemployed (working in a position that
              is lower than one’s skills/training) as a result of the COVID-19

              have faced a disproportionate burden from the COVID-19 epidemic,
              with the travel, hospitality and entertainment (aside from gaming)
